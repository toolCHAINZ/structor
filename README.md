# Structor (v1.0)
Author: **toolCHAINZ**
_A dead-simple automatic struct maker_
## Description:
`Structor` simplifies the process of defining structs based on usage in a function. Simply go to MLIL view, right click on an instruction you thing might be a structure usage, and structor will make a type for you! The analysis is very bare-bones and could no doubt be improved.
